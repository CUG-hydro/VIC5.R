# VIC5 0.2.1

- This package is the new generation of `VICmodel`, which is withdrawed from cran
  due to warnings in Linux system. This time, we solved those warnings.

- Routing function was removed from this package, as this package is mainly
  aimed to interface with the VIC hydrological model in C language.

- add the function `vic_params`, which makes VIC global parameter setting much easier.
