\title{Sample datasets of the Stehekin for the running of the VIC model
provided by UW Hydro}
\format{
A list including meteorological forcing data, soil parameters,
vegetation parameters, vegetation library, snowband parameters
and vegetation forcing data for 16 0.25 degree gridcells.
The dataset is provided by the
\href{http://uw-hydro.github.io/}{Computational Hydrology group},
Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at the
University of Washington.

This is a list containing:
\describe{
\item{forcing}{10-day hourly meteorological forcing data from
1949-01-01 to 1949-01-10, including precipitation, air temperature,
longwave and shortwave radiation, wind speed, vapor pressure, and
air pressure.}
\item{soil}{soil parameters for 16 gridcells.}
\item{veg}{vegetation parameters for 16 gridcells.}
\item{snowbands}{elevation band (snow band) parameters.}
\item{veglib}{vegetation library.}
\item{forcing_veg}{vegetation forcing data including LAI,
fraction of canopy, and albedo. This is generated by simply temporally
repeat the values of \code{veglib} according to \code{veg}.}
\item{runoff_table_daily}{Three-year daily runoff outputs of the
VIC model from 1949-01-01 to 1951-12-31. This is as the sample input data
of the streamflow routing model of Lohmann in the form of output table
returned by \code{\link[=vic]{vic()}}, containing two output variable:
\code{OUT_RUNOFF} and \code{OUT_BASEFLOW}.}
\item{streamflow_obs}{Observed streamflow series to be the reference to
evaluate the streamflow simulation results.}
